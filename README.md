# twilio-functions
hotline, for incoming calls + texts to a volunteer request phone number; node.js, Twilio API, Airtable API

each of these .js files correspond with Functions written in the Twilio console - where they're also attached to events (when a voice call comes in to the phone number, when an SMS comes into the phone number, etc.)
